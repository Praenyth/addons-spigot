## A collection of addons from the voices in my head.

This features quality stuff like pipebombs and a joke book.

### Pipebombs
The pipebombs are special bombs you can craft like this:

Put them in a chest, close it and open it back up and you have a portable explosion!

### Joke Book
The joke books are just renamed regular books as "Joke Book" that play a sound when right clicked.

I personally set it as a sound to a laugh track, this book is basically a walking soundboard that plays one sound.

**Feel free to leave suggestions in Github Issues under the "enhancement" tag :)**
